Predictive Modeling based on Medical Data using deep learning (CNN and RNN); a Health Compass project with ORX Surgical

# Project Background
We experiment with different machine learning algorithms to evaluate different approaches to predicting a specific device-intensive procedure. The performance of various CNN and RNN algorithms are investigated to select the correct approach in partnership with ORX.

ORX is interested in developing machine learning models based on insurance claims and other medical data to predict whether a patient requires a device-intensive procedure.
